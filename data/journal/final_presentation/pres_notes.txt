Plots:

- Make parameter for line color - use the seaboard colorpallete
- Make label for legend - dots/stripes (for both mean and error) - maybe this should show on the graph? 

Analysis:
- Quantitative way to compare polynomial curves - the coefficients donâ€™t match

ERROR IN CURVE FIT!!

must mention performance

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND:
- can help to have sketches explaining what the method is, the model (hard to understand equations)
- can simplify things in theoretical background

- Everyone needs to be able to answer questions

Sophia:
- Theory and animations
- Minkowski metric
